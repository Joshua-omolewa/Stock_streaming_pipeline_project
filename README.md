# Real time Stock Streaming Data-pipeline (ETL) Project

# Author: üë§ **Joshua Omolewa**

## PROJECT OVERVIEW : I designed and implemented a real-time streaming pipeline to extract stock data from a stock API and build dashboards that monitor the stocks in real-time. The pipeline uses Apache Nifi for data ingestion and a MySQL database to store the data. To capture the changes in the database, I used Debezium, a Change Data Capture (CDC) tool that publishes the changes to a Kafka topic in Amazon MSK using the Debezium MySQL connector. The stock data in the Kafka topic is transformed using Spark Streaming and then loaded into the Glue database. I used Athena to query the Glue database to create real-time dashboards using Power BI and Tableau. The pipeline is orchestrated using Airflow, an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows

## 1. Business Scenario
A Bank requires a data Engineer to build a streaming pipeline that tracks stocks in near real time and to develop a dashboard that tracks the changes in stock price in near real time.


## 2. STEPS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT 

### Please note: The realtime stock streaming pipeline was built using  Python language. The pyspark script utilizes spark streaming and HUDI for transforming the stock data in the Amazon EMR cluster. 

* Built a stock API using FASTAPI framework that tracks Amazon and Apple stock gotten from  **[Alpha vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)** stock  **[API  (1min Intraday(extended history)](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)** . The stock API is used to trigger airflow as soon as it recieves a get request for the stock data. Kindly find the sample query used to get the stock data from the Alphavantage stock API **[here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Stock_streaming_pipeline_project/blob/main/download%20stock%20data%20from%20API.txt)** (Please note the API return data in CSV format). The stock data from Alphavantage is stored in S3 which my stock API reads from. I created a landing page for my API using HTML & CSS as seen in the image below. The API is hosted using NGINX so the API is accessible anywhere in the world  and the API runs in Amazon EC2. The Fast API code can be found **[here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Stock_streaming_pipeline_project/blob/main/api.py)**  . Please note other stock market API offer websocket protocol ( **[polygon.io](https://polygon.io/)** ,  **[Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/)** ) to ingest real time stock data but payment is required to have access hence I decided to create my own API with similar stock payload using Alphavantage Stock API which is free.

* I then created an Amazon EC2 instance in which I hosted some docker containers for Apache Nifi, MySQL & Debezium. I built a data ingestion pipeline using Apache Nifi ( see Apache Nifi Architecture in the image below) which ingest the stock data from my stock API and inserts the stock data into a MySQL database. I implemented  Change Data Capture (CDC) using debezium (with MySQL connector) which track the changes in the MySQL database and streams the changes to a kafka topic in Amazon MSK. My Apache Nifi template architecture can be found **[here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Stock_streaming_pipeline_project/blob/main/Joshua-final-stocks-nifi.xml)**

* Created docker containers runing Airflow using docker compost  within an EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) instance. The stock API trigger airflow as soon as stock data is being ingested by Apache Nifi. Airflow is used to trigger lamb
da function which send a post request to submit the spark job  to the Amazon EMR cluster using post request sent to Livy  .Airflow monitor the spark job through Livy to ensure the spark job did not fail in the EMR cluster. The airflow python code for the airflow dags can be found **[here](https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/Stock_streaming_pipeline_project/blob/main/aiflowlambda.py)**

* Finally I created a docker container that runs superset in an EC2 instance. Superset can be used to create Data Visualization  & dashboards  by the Data Analyst. <img src="https://github.com/Joshua-omolewa/end-2-end_data_pipeline_project/blob/main/img/Superset%20finals.jpg"  width="100%" height="100%">
